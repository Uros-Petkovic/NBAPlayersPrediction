# NBAPlayersPrediction

The goal of this project is to predict NBA Players performance for future 5 years with common Machine Learning algorithms.

Dataset used for training and testing in project is [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/NBAPlayersPrediction/blob/main/NBA_data.csv).

Project is a variety of machine learning algorithms. Used algorithms are Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

For the whole project pipline and results go [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/NBAPlayersPrediction/blob/main/NBA_Players_Prediction.ipynb).
